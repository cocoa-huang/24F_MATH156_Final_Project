# 24F_MATH156_Final_Project
This is a Github Repo hosting the Colab version of our final project for Math 156 Machine Learning. You can click the link in the notebook to access the Colab.

Topic: Deep Learning Network using ResNet18 structure to predict germen traffic signs using the [GTSRB dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign/data?select=Train).

The model is completely based on the ResNet acrchitecture proposed in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385).

Group member: Eric Huang, Marvin Wong, Lawrence Lee, Ernest Leung
